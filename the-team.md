## Co-founders

### Cara Jo Miller

Cara Jo is a Boulder transplant by way of Detroit, where she helped start the Girl Develop It's Detroit chapter. She coded her first website back in 1996, which was a gallery for her Pokemon drawings. After moving to Detroit, she moved beyond HTML/CSS to PHP and while simultaneous becoming obsessed with WordPress. After five years of urban living in Detroit, Cara Jo decided mountain living was for her. She'd heard the tech and startup scenes in Boulder were great and decided to take the plunge out west. She now wrangles pixels and writes code as the Lead Designer for Simple Energy. Getting more women involved in tech has always been one of Cara Jo's passions, and that's what she brings to Boulder.

*In addition to being Boulder's Co-Leader, Cara Jo teaches Introduction & Intermediate HTML/CSS classes, & various workshops.*
